## ‚úçÔ∏è How CTD develops curriculum

Code the Dream's curriculum is developed by CTD staff, contracted Curriculum Specialists, and dedicated volunteer subject-matter experts. Our Curriculum Board meets periodically to evaluate data from students, consider curriculum feedback, and conduct long-term planning.

We utilize a few key frameworks in our planning: 
  * **Flipped Classroom** and **Project-Based Learning** models.
  * **Backwards Design**
  * **Universal Design for Learning** and special care for English-language-learners.

If you would like to be closely involved in curriculum development as a Curriculum Specialist or volunteer subject-matter expert, contact Reid Russom (reid@codethedream.org).

  * **Small-Scale Feedback:** Feel free to submit pull requests fixing simple issues like **typos**, **incorrect sample code**, or **unclear wording**.
